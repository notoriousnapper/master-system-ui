============ WARNINGS =================
1. WATCH OUT FOR SPACES IN EXCEL FILE - WILL RUIN THINGS
2. TAKE CARE OF IT IN CODE 
============ INSTRUCTIONS ===============================
1. Alter configs.js - [exercises on what days, settings]!
2. Alter data in csv files -- (Save to data folder) to see updates

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS:
I. BASED ON TIME< LOCATION, OPTIONS, AND TIME OF DAY,
SHOW DIFFERENT THINGS
II. ENABLE - TRACKING SIMPLE - wherever you are, simple.  lets go
III. - Clean up "Generate List" to easier methods/ separate code!
III. - THEN, entire system overhaul in java!

================================================================================
==== MORE TODO's ====
1. How to build in type safety/ checks in your code
Write tests, add schemas and locks?
2. LEARN TO RUN JS in webstorm to debug!
=3. POST EXAMPLES OF FORMAT OF DATA THAT YOU NEED --> (speciically, on the list level
it requires an array for each piece of data)
4. Eventual GOAL
    csvparse -> Store as Object in memory (Exercise Schema) -> 
        parser -> HTML interface 
        
        
5. compare time spent i
 react vs. what I'm doing for code gen?
